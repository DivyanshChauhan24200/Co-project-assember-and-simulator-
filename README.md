This Project deals with some basic instructions which RISC V ISA is supoorting, we deal with some part of instruction of ISA.
We deal with instcution of R-type , I-type, S-type, B-type, J-type. For implement these type of instruction, we design an assembler which takes these input in form of assembly language
